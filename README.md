# eVentz - An Eventing Web Application
-----

#### eVentz is my idea for mapping events in a chosen city. eVentz will help manage schedules for a wide gamut of organizers. Typical organizers can be academic institutions conducting classes or a Hotel conducting a conference etc. The web application will have three main sets of users.

* General Public or Attendees who are interested in participating in an event
  * Browse local events - a google map of all events
  * Sign up to participate in an event
  * Ability to buy online
  * Lookup events based on individual preference
  * Get a schedule of events for a certain period (a week to a month) either by printing or google calendar
* Organizers who conduct these events
  * Sign up to manage events
  * Academic institutions, Hotels, Community, Religious, local meetup groups etc
  * Organizers can manage scheduling of events based on their infrastructure
  * Payments for these events by attendees will be online
  * Build events before a peak season or a semester
  * Tagging of events to google calendar or printing to a PDF
  * Manage proposal and price quotes for speakers of events
* Speakers
  * Look up events based on personal preferences
  * Sign up to participate in events
  * Ability to accept or reject an event proposal
  * Tagging of events to google calendar or printing to a PDF
  * Service Provider
  * Admin panel to manage users
  * Generate statistics on events

* Roadmap:
  * Provide a list of API for scheduling events
  * Ability to like or dislike events
  * Forum to discuss on an event
  * Organizers conduct surveys at the end of an event for feedback
